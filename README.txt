This project is a simple sample sequencer. It can hold nine different samples, which must be named s1.wav, s2.wav etc. 
To sequence your samples, create a text file named "TAB.txt" and place it on the SD card. 
In this file, you can document 9 songs; each line is a song. 
Sequence your samples by writing their corresponding numbers in the order you wish them to be played.
Use the center button to play the song, and the left and right buttons to move down or up songs. 
The samples included were originally going to be breakbeats of my own design, however I could not get the conversion to be satisfactory enough.
